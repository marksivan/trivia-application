# Adaptive Trivia Application

Created and Designed by: **Irenee Niyibaho & Mark Sivan Tamakloe**
Try it out here: https://marksivan.github.io/trivia-application/ 

This is both a Terminal-based and GUI-based Java trivia game application with a bank of questions in different fields that adopts our real-time adaptive questioning and recommendation system. This local app models the user experience based on real world experience. Questions dynamically adjust in difficulty based on a player's performance to maintain an engaging and challenging experience.

## 🧠 Game Logic

▶️ Start with medium-difficulty questions.

🔼 Answer 3 questions correctly in a row → the next question is hard 🟩 (worth more points)

🔽 Answer 3 questions incorrectly in a row → the next question is easy 🟥 (worth fewer points)

✅ After getting the first correct answer on an easy question → return to medium difficulty

🧠 Difficulty adapts in real-time to keep the game dynamic and personalized.


The game uses **min-heaps and max-heaps** to manage and prioritize questions:

- 📥 `MaxHeap.java`: Efficiently retrieves hard questions with the highest difficulty scores.
- 📤 `MinHeap.java`: Quickly accesses the easiest questions available.
- 📊 `PriorityQueue.java`: Manages underlying heap behavior to streamline dynamic transitions.
- 📋 Medium questions are selected randomly from an `ArrayList`.


## Play Online (GitHub Pages)

A modern browser version of the trivia game is available in the [`docs/`](docs/) folder and deploys automatically to GitHub Pages.

**Live site:** [https://marksivan.github.io/trivia-application/](https://marksivan.github.io/trivia-application/)

### Web features

- Responsive design with light/dark mode
- All 8 categories with 470+ questions
- Real-time adaptive difficulty (same heap logic as the Java backend)
- Configurable timer, question count, and local high scores

### Local preview

```bash
python3 scripts/build-questions.py
cd docs && python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### Enable GitHub Pages (one-time)

1. Go to **Settings → Pages** in the GitHub repository
2. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**
3. Push to `main` — the workflow in [`.github/workflows/pages.yml`](.github/workflows/pages.yml) publishes the site
